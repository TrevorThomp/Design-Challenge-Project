        <p class="travel-p">People have been traveling since the beginning of time. The nature of this activity for
          every individual is entirely different. Some people like traveling for entertainment, some for business, and
          some for medical purposes.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">There are countless other reasons why people visit different places. People in different
          parts of the world usually travel to areas that are the polar opposite of the regions they typically reside in
          which is understandable.</p>
        <img src="../images/Woman-Wearing-Jacket-300x200.jpg" alt="Woman Wearing Red Travel Jacket">
        <p class="travel-p">The reason for this is because they get to see new scenery and experience new weather and
          conditions. Experiencing all of these new and different things every once in a while freshens a person’s mind.

        <h2 class="travel-h2" id="past">Why Travelling Was Uncomfortable In The Past</h2>
        <p class="travel-p">Even though travel was highly prevalent back in the day, it was neither easy nor comfortable
          to travel. There were limited means of transportation, and people did not know how to prepare for this
          activity.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">It resulted in people getting ill, and in some cases, they even died. You have to
          <strong>ready yourself</strong> for the harshest and most extreme of conditions as you never know when the
          weather might change. The first mistake people made was that they did not know what kind of garments they
          should be carrying along with themselves while traveling. </p>
        <p class="travel-p">They usually took the same clothes they wore back at home, not knowing that the weather in
          the other country might be extremely hot or cold. This lack of knowledge was also because there wasn't a lot
          of readily available information back in the day and people had to rely on word of mouth to get any knowledge.
        </p>
        <p class="travel-p">As time went by, awareness increased and especially with the availability of the internet,
          all kinds of authentic information is available at a person's fingertips. Now, people know what garments they
          should be carrying with them, although some people could still make better choices.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">Some garments are infinitely better than the others when it comes to protecting a person
          from the harmful elements the weather brings along. For example, wearing a sweater is quintessential for the
          winter season as it will keep you warm and make sure that your skin doesn't suffer significant damage.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">Oppositely, wearing a sweater in summers, you will put yourself at the risk of exhaustion
          and profuse sweating; wearing a light material shirt would be a better choice for summers.</p>
        <img src="../images/Sweater-In-Summer-300x300.jpg"
          alt="Woman wearing a sweater in summer heat with hand to head">
        <p class="travel-p">Similarly, if you live at a place where it rains continuously, it would be a wise choice to
          keep a couple of raincoats at your disposal, as they not only protect your clothing, but they also protect you
          from other harmful elements of the rain.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">Travelers of this day and age are savvy enough to know most of these things, and nearly all
          of them pack accordingly. As we briefly mentioned earlier, travel was not easy back in the day, and people had
          to go through numerous hurdles to reach their destinations and come back.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">Means of communication, transport, and essential safety items that we have in this day and
          age were not available back in the day, making the lives of travelers twice as hard.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">It would be <strong>safe to say</strong> that most of the travelers in the old age were
          purely depending on their luck to reach their destination without any significant problem. You will be
          surprised to find out that pre-historic traveling has also been the source of a few plagues.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">A healthy person would go to another country and catch some form of contagious illness or
          disease, he or she would then come back to their home country only to unknowingly spread the disease to
          hundreds and thousands of people.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">Things have completely changed in this day and age, however, as you have to take many
          measures before even stepping foot in another country. The passage of time has given people extensive
          knowledge and wealth which has led them to make numerous discoveries and inventions to take better take care
          of themselves and their fellow beings.</p>

        <h2 class="travel-h2" id="now">Traveling Has Become Safer Now</h2>
        <p class="travel-p">Travel could not be any safer today, but some people in different parts of the world still
          do not feel safe while traveling. Numerous causes trigger a lot of discomfort among these travelers which is
          why they eventually hold themselves back from extensive touring. Despite that, not only is traveling safer,
          but it is much more comfortable.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">The means of transportation are significantly better than they were back in the day and
          there are numerous options of transportation to choose from which is great. The ever-increasing number of
          travelers in recent years has made traveling a full-fledged business, which has been making considerable
          profits and showing no signs of stopping.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">Because the traveling industry has significantly risen over the years, people scrutinize
          everything with great detail which has led to the creation of numerous traveling items that one thought were
          not possible a few years ago.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">Protective clothing is one of the things that have risen to the occasion time and time again
          for travelers. People used to fill their bags with too much clothing whenever they were preparing to travel.
          It caused them to slightly overpack, which meant that either they had to get rid of some of their stuff or
          they had to pay some extra money and carry the heavy luggage around with them.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">Thankfully, things have become more sophisticated now, and a few clothes do the trick for
          most people. Although these clothes are well and good and provide <strong>sufficient protection</strong> to
          people who are traveling, they still lack some essential elements that could make them the best traveling
          clothing out there.</p>
        <img src="../images/Buckling-Jacket-300x214.jpg" alt="Person buttoning jacket">
        <p class="travel-p">Thankfully, we do not have to worry about waiting for the best traveling clothes out there.
          We are fortunate to have something that has all the potential of changing the traveling game for good once and
          for all. In case you are wondering what we are talking about, travel jackets are what we expect to be the
          traveling game changer.</p>

        <h2 class="travel-h2" id="what">What Is A Travel Jacket?</h2>
        <p class="travel-p"><a class="travel-a">Traveling jackets</a> have garnered a lot of buzz around them lately.
          They have proven to be extremely useful for people who do not want to pack loads of stuff with them before
          traveling. As we discussed earlier, touring used to be extremely difficult for people in the old days and they
          had to pack their suitcases with loads of clothes.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">Traveling jackets eliminate all of these problems smoothly, as these jackets are
          substantially similar to a suitcase. Who wouldn't want to have a wearable bag with them at all times? There
          are different variations of travel jackets available in the market, all of them are specifically designed to
          provide ease and comfort to travelers at all times.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">You can now say goodbye to heavy suitcases as travel jackets essentially eliminate the need
          of having many clothes. These jackets have numerous features and functions that people could not have even
          imagined previously.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">On the surface, these jackets seem like every other jacket that you would see people
          wearing, but once you take a quick peek, you will soon discover the sophisticated design of the travel jacket.
          Their advanced design helps the travelers tremendously in carrying around their luggage.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">It doesn't necessarily mean that your jacket could store all of the stuff your suitcase
          could; it means that you would not have to carry as much stuff as you used to previously and your heavy
          luggage will be adequately replaced with a lighter one.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">Some of the features that make travel jackets a must-have for everyone are the multiple
          built-in pockets inside them. These pockets are <strong>placed strategically</strong> to make sure that people
          are easily able to reach out to their stuff and grab it with ease.</p>

        <div id="pocket-list">
          <ul>
            <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>A 10 to 12-inch tablet</li>
            <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>Multiple cell phones</li>
            <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>A 2 liter bottle</li>
            <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>Your passport and diary</li>
            <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>An inflatable pillow</li>
            <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>A mini camera</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="travel-p">These pockets are also spacious, making sure that the jacket doesn't go through unnecessary
          wear and tear. If you are wondering what kind of items could the jacket hold, down below are just a few things
          among many others that these jackets can hold comfortably.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">You would not be able to feel the weight of the items you are carrying around significantly
          as weight distribution of the travel jackets is on another level and a mystery to behold. The pockets alone
          are enough to make one want to get hold of these travel jackets as soon as possible, but you will find it
          surprising that we have barely scratched the surface of these travel jackets.</p>
        <img src="../images/Multiple-Pockets-300x300.jpg" alt="Person holding jacket open to show multiple pockets">
        <p class="travel-p">You wouldn't even need to carry around a pillow with you as travel jackets solve that
          problem by providing you with a built-in cushion which is present inside the travel jacket. The cushions are
          usually attached to the hood of the travel jacket, making it easy to rest your head at any place. You can
          comfortably sleep for hours on the pillows inside travel jackets.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">Hand-warming pockets are another <strong>excellent function</strong> present inside
          traveling jackets. These come in especially handy for people who are going to countries that are extremely
          cold. You would also have access to an eye mask, making sure that your eyes are safe from numerous harmful
          elements. There is even a sunglass holder present in these traveling jackets.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">You would not have to worry about your sunglasses falling off or carrying them separately.
          The sunglass holder holds the glasses with a smooth grip, and you can only remove them if you take them out
          yourself. The travel jacket also has earphone holders, and similar to the sunglass holders, they hold the
          earphones with a firm grip.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">One of the most important things that we forgot to mention is the fact that some varieties
          of travel jackets have a specially designed pocket for power banks. In this day and age, it is almost
          impossible to go anywhere without your gadgets, such as cell phones, cameras, laptops, and tablets.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">People who travel long distance are often concerned about the fact that they would not be
          able to charge their gadgets en route.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">Well, the travel jackets prove to be the saving grace once again as the power bank pockets
          inside them make sure that you are easily able to charge your gadgets without looking for steady places to
          keep them. Everything would be on your body, and you would not have to fret about losing.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">With the ability to store so much stuff, one might wonder how they could go to the airport
          without making the security wonder if they are smuggling something inside the jacket. Well, all we have to say
          to that is, do not worry.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">The design these jackets have makes sure that the stuff you carry doesn't bulge out of your
          travel jacket. You will be easily able to take everything without people raising suspicion.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">Some companies also provide travel footrest and travel blankets along with the travel
          jackets, offering you the ultimate care during your traveling expeditions. There are countless other items and
          features that the traveling jackets come along with and it would require a book to write all of the fantastic
          things that travel jackets are capable of doing.</p>

        <h2 class="travel-h2" id="kickstart">Skyrocketing Popularity Of Travel Jackets With The Kick Starter</h2>
        <p class="travel-p">We can credit Kick Starter for the ever-increasing popularity of travel jackets. These
          jackets were already famous, but kick starter took them to a whole different playing field where virtually
          everyone was demanding travel jackets. In case you do not know what Kick Starter is, it is a platform that
          allows people to prove their creativity through crowdfunding.</p>
        <img src="../images/Company-Logo-300x196.png" alt="kickstarter logo">
        <p class="travel-p">Travel jackets existed way before kick starter, but the person who created the travel jacket
          through crowdfunding on Kick Starter essentially made all of the previous travel jackets irrelevant. 2015 was
          the year when travel jackets <strong>started gaining traction</strong> all over the world through Kick
          Starter.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">These jackets were in high demand as soon as they were announced and sold out immediately
          within a matter of days. A couple of years later, these jackets received a considerable upgrade. Added
          features and functions made sure that the travel jackets were not going away anywhere soon and they live up to
          their buzz.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">There are four unique styles that the travel jackets are available in nowadays. Windbreaker,
          sweatshirt, bomber, and vest are the four styles that have become famous among travel jacket enthusiasts. Even
          though travel jackets were designed for globetrotters initially, they are used by other people like students
          and adventurists as well.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">The people who created travel jackets on Kick Starter thought that the introduction of their
          jackets would eventually saturate the market and the demand for their jackets would get lower. However, things
          turned out to be great, and the need for travel jackets increased more than ever before.</p>

        <h3 class="travel-h3" id="bauxbax">The Success Of Bauxbax On Kick Starter</h3>
        <p class="travel-p">Baubax is the brand that people mostly associate travel jackets with these days. It is the
          brand that we mentioned that received the tremendous success on Kick Starter. The reason why Baubax stands
          ahead of many other travel jacket brands is the fact that they can come up with unique ideas that people least
          expect.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">These ideas have been continuously changing travel jackets and have evolved them from the
          simple jackets they used to be a few years ago. The ability of Bauxbax to stay ahead of time is what makes it
          so high in demand and part of that can be credited to Kick Starter.</p>

        <h3 class="travel-h3" id="plus">The Rise Of Similar Products Such As Plus Jackets</h3>
        <p class="travel-p">The popularity of travel jackets has made people come up with various ideas that resemble
          it. People started coming up with similar products, and the Plus Jacket is one of them. The Plus Jacket is a
          utility jacket which shares a lot of similarities with the travel jacket created by Baubax.</p>
        <p class="travel-p">If you take a quick look at the features of the Plus Jacket, you will be astounded to find
          out that these jackets have almost the same features and functions as the travel jackets. You would be
          hard-pressed to find any significant differences other than the design in the Plus Jacket.</p>

        <h2 class="travel-h2" id="onthego">How Travel Jackets Allow You To Maintain Discipline On The Go</h2>
        <p class="travel-p">People who are always on the go, often have the problem of keeping their control because of
          having to go to various places to get their work done. Traveling jackets prove to be the one stop shop for
          these people as they would not have to go to different places. They would have everything at their disposal.
        </p>
        <img src="../images/Couple-In-Travel-Jackets-300x200.png" alt="couple in blue and red travel jackets">
        <p class="travel-p">Students have been <strong>one of the greatest</strong> beneficiaries of travel jackets as
          they do not have to carry heavy bags around with them anymore.</p>

        <h2 class="travel-h2" id="features">Features To Look Out For When Buying A Travel Jacket</h2>
        <p class="travel-p">There are many travel jackets available in the market. Looking out for some unique features
          will ensure that you can get the best travel jacket money can buy.</p>

        <h3 class="travel-h3" id="lightweight">Lightweight</h3>
        <p class="travel-p">Having a lightweight jacket is a no-brainer. No one wants to walk with a lot of weight on
          their upper body. There are numerous lightweight travel jackets available that can store your stuff without
          making you bear the burden.</p>

        <h3 class="travel-h3" id="comfortable">Comfortable</h3>
        <p class="travel-p">Several travel jackets offer a lot of utility to the traveler, but the one thing these
          jackets are lacking is the comfort. Be sure to check the travel jacket before buying it. See that they aren't
          too tight as they would give you immense discomfort during your travels.</p>

        <h3 class="travel-h3" id="good">Good Looking</h3>
        <p class="travel-p">No one wants to wear a jacket that looks like a duffel bag. Everyone wants to wear something
          stylish, and there should be no exception with travel jackets. There are numerous styles in which travel
          jackets are available nowadays. Choose the one that suits you best.</p>

        <h3 class="travel-h3" id="waterproof">Waterproof</h3>
        <p class="travel-p">Make sure that the travel jacket that you buy is waterproof. People often make the grave
          mistake of purchasing a travel jacket that is not resistant to water and tends to damage a lot of the items
          that they are carrying in their travel jackets.</p>

        <h3 class="travel-h3" id="perfect">Perfect For All Kinds Of Weather</h3>
        <p class="travel-p">Instead of buying several jackets for different weather conditions, get hold of one that is
          suitable for any weather. It will make sure that you do not have to spend too much money and a single jacket
          does the trick for all seasons.</p>

        <h3 class="travel-h3" id="breathable">Make Sure That The Fabric Is Breathable</h3>
        <p class="travel-p">A common problem people have regarding jackets is the fact that they do not find the jackets
          to be breathable. Always check that the material isn't too tight or heavy that it becomes uncomfortable for
          you. Breathable fabric <strong>ensures that you do not sweat</strong> profusely throughout your travel.</p>
